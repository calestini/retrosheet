A project to parse [retrosheet](https://www.retrosheet.org) baseball data in python. All data contained at Retrosheet site is copyright Â© 1996-2003 by Retrosheet. All Rights Reserved.

## Motivation

The motivation behind this project is to enhance python-based baseball analytics, from data collection to advanced predictive modeling techniques.

## Getting Started

### Downloading Package

Run the following code to create the folder structure
```bash
git clone https://github.com/calestini/retrosheet.git
```

### Downloading historical data to csv

**Note: This package is a work in progress, and the files are not yet fully parsed, and statistics not fully validated.**

The code below will save data from 1921 to 2017 in your machine. Be careful as it will take some time to download it all (~10 min if the datasets for each year are locally stored).

```python
from retrosheet import Retrosheet
rs = Retrosheet()
rs.get_data(yearFrom=1921, yearTo=2017)
rs.save_csv()
```
```bash
>>> [========------------------] 33.5% ... 1959
```

## Files it will download / create:

  - plays.csv
  - teams.csv
  - rosters.csv
  - lineup.csv
  - pitching.csv
  - fielding.csv
  - batting.csv
  - running.csv
  - info.csv

  - For the events file, the pitches field sometimes repeats over the following role, whenever there was a play (CS, SB, etc.). In these cases, the code needs to remove the duplication.

### Play Field in Event File:

  - What does 'BF' in '1/BF' stand for? bunt fly?
  - Why some specific codes for modifier are 2R / 2RF / 8RM / 8RS / 8RXD / L9Ls / RNT ?
